-- Latent Dirichlet Allocation
______________________________

- What is it : 
A topic modelling technique that can classify text in a document to a particular
topic.
In other words, it's a technique used to map documents in a corpus to topics.

- How does it work:
Assumptions of LDA topic modelling:
  - Documents with similar topics use similar groups of words
  - Latent topics can then be found by searching for groups of 
  words that frequently occur together in documents across the corpus
  - Documents are probability distributions over latent topics which 
  signifies certain document will contain more words of a specific topic.
  - Topics themselves are probability distribution over words


Important
  - The users must decide on amount of topics present in the document
  - the user must interpret what the topics are
